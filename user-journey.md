# User Journey

## Updated Journey (4b final submission)

[screen-recording](updated-user-journey.mp4)

A user named Atlas likes reading ebooks, but wishes there were better customization and annotation tools. They decide to use FocusReader. They first navigate to the website, and create an account. Then, Atlas goes to the Library page, and uploads the ebook they want to read. After the upload finishes, they open the book and start reading. As they read, they decide to make a few highlights and a few annotations, and then they close the book. They repeat the process with another book. They're curious about how long they read for, so they go to the stats page to look at their reading statistics for both books, and each book individually.
